## Description
>You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.

```
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5
```

## Solution
```
We can use greedy solution
cnt[i] means the count of numbers that we have not placed yet
tail[i] means the number of consecutive subarray ended with i
```

```python
class Solution:
    def isPossible(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        cnt, tail = collections.Counter(nums), collections.Counter()
        for i in nums:
            if cnt[i] == 0: continue # we have run out of i
            cnt[i] -= 1
            if tail[i - 1] > 0: # if we can append the number to the previous consecutive subarray, just do it
                tail[i - 1] -= 1
                tail[i] += 1
            # if we can not append the number to previous subarray, we should start a new subarray, it starts with i
            elif cnt[i + 1] > 0 and cnt[i + 2] > 0: 
                cnt[i + 1] -= 1
                cnt[i + 2] -= 1
                tail[i + 2] += 1
            else: return False
        return True
```
