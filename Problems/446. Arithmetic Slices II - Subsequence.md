## Description
>A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

```
Input: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

Output: 7

Explanation:
All arithmetic subsequence slices are:
[2,4,6]
[4,6,8]
[6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8]
[4,6,8,10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
[2,6,10]
```
## Solution
```
For every i, there should be a dict stores the d and number of arithmetic subsequences ending with A[i] and dis == d.
And the key function should be d[i][dif] += d[j][dif] + 1
for example:
1,2,3,4
if A[j] = 3 and A[i] = 4, then d[i][1] += d[j][1] + 1 where d[j][1] = 1 because we can not only get 1,2,3,4 but also 2,3,4 ending with 4
where 1,2,3,4 is got by appending 4 to 1,2,3, so we should add d[j][1]; 2,3,4 is got by appending 4 to 2,3, so we should add another 1
```

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numberOfArithmeticSlices(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(A)
        d = {}
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            d[i] = collections.defaultdict(int)
            for j in range(i):
                dif = A[i] - A[j]
                toAdd = d[j][dif]
                res += toAdd
                d[i][dif] += toAdd + 1
        return res
```
