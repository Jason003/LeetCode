## Description

```
Given a function rand7 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 7, write a function rand10 which generates a uniform random integer in the range 1 to 10.

Do NOT use system's Math.random().
```
## Solution
```
# The rand7() API is already defined for you.
# def rand7():
# @return a random integer in the range 1 to 7

class Solution:
    def rand10(self):
        """
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = 40
        while res >= 40: # make sure the res is in [0, 39] uniformly
            res = 7 * (rand7() - 1) + (rand7() - 1) # generate numbers in [0, 48]
        return res % 10 + 1
```
