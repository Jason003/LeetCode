## Description

```
We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value K.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.
```

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2

Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.

## Solution
```
We can use 2 dfs to deal with it, the first is to find the distance of a certain node to target node and store them in 'd'.
In this procedure, there are some nodes that we can not get distance, like '1' in the example.
And then, use another dfs to append the safisfactory nodes to result array.
As we can get the distance between root and target in first dfs, we can get the distance between '1' and target in second dfs~
If the node is already in the cache 'd', update the current distance with d[node].
```

```python
class Solution:
    def distanceK(self, root, target, K):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type target: TreeNode
        :type K: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        d = {}
        res = []
        def getDis(node):
            if not node: return -1
            if node in d: return d[node]
            if node == target:
                d[node] = 0
                return 0
            l = getDis(node.left)
            if l != -1:
                d[node] = l + 1
                return l + 1
            r = getDis(node.right)
            if r != -1:
                d[node] = r + 1
                return r + 1
            return -1
        def dfs(node, dis):
            if not node: return
            if node in d: dis = d[node]
            if dis == K: res.append(node.val)
            dfs(node.left, dis + 1)
            dfs(node.right, dis + 1)
        getDis(root)
        dfs(root, 0)
        return res
```
