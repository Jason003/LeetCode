## Description
```
A string of '0's and '1's is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of '0's (possibly 0), followed by some number of '1's (also possibly 0.)

We are given a string S of '0's and '1's, and we may flip any '0' to a '1' or a '1' to a '0'.

Return the minimum number of flips to make S monotone increasing.

Input: "00110"
Output: 1
Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
```

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def minFlipsMonoIncr(self, S: str) -> int:
        # zeroLeft[i] is the number of 0 in the left size of index i (including i), so is zeroRight
        n = len(S)
        zeroLeft, zeroRight = [0] * n, [0] * n
        zeroLeft[0] = 1 if S[0] == '0' else 0
        zeroRight[-1] = 1 if S[-1] == '0' else 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            zeroLeft[i] = zeroLeft[i - 1] + (1 if S[i] == '0' else 0)
        for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
            zeroRight[i - 1] = zeroRight[i] + (1 if S[i - 1] == '0' else 0)
        res = n
        for i in range(n):
            res = min(res, (i + 1 - zeroLeft[i]) + (zeroRight[i + 1] if i + 1 < n else 0))
        return min(res, n - zeroLeft[-1], zeroLeft[-1])
        
        '''
        res is the minimum flip we should do at present
        one is the current number of one we have met(if we have set res = one before, all of the one before have been flipped to zero)
        '''
        res, one = 0, 0
        for c in S:
            if c == '0':
                if not one: continue
                res += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            res = min(res, one)
        return res
