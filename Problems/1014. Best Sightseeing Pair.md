## Description

```
Given an array A of positive integers, A[i] represents the value of the i-th sightseeing spot, and two sightseeing spots i and j have distance j - i between them.

The score of a pair (i < j) of sightseeing spots is (A[i] + A[j] + i - j) : the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, minus the distance between them.

Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.
```
## Solution 

We should find the max(A[i] + i + A[j] - j), we can advance j from 1 to n - 1, during this process, as i < j, we can update i once A[i] + 1 < A[j] + j

```python
class Solution:
    def maxScoreSightseeingPair(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        res = -float('inf')
        i = 0
        for j in range(1, len(A)):
            res = max(res, A[i] + i + A[j] - j)
            if A[i] + i < A[j] + j: i = j
        return res
```
