## Description
>Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```

## Solution
This problem can be regarded as a follow up of LIS, we can use two arrays to do dp
The first array is dp, dp[i] means the length of LIS ended at i
The second array is cnt, cnt[i] means the number of LIS that the length of them is equal to maxlen
```python
class Solution:
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [1] * n
        maxl = 0
        res = 0
        cnt = [1] * n
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    if dp[i] < dp[j] + 1:
                        cnt[i] = cnt[j]
                        dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
                    elif dp[i] == dp[j] + 1:
                        cnt[i] += cnt[j]
            if maxl < dp[i]:
                maxl = dp[i]
                res = cnt[i]
            elif maxl == dp[i]:
                res += cnt[i]
        return res
```
