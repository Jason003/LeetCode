## Description
>Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.
```
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def reconstructQueue(self, people):
        '''
        if you are taller, you stand first, and then the shorter person 
        will insert to the queue according to their index
        (the future inserted person will not be taller than him, because array is sorted desc)
        '''        
        res = []
        for p in sorted(people, key = lambda x: (-x[0], x[1])): 
            res.insert(p[1], p)
        return res
```
