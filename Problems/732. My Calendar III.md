## Description
>Implement a MyCalendarThree class to store your events. A new event can always be added.

>Your class will have one method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

>A K-booking happens when K events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to all K events.)

>For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return an integer K representing the largest integer such that there exists a K-booking in the calendar.

>Your class will be called like this: MyCalendarThree cal = new MyCalendarThree(); MyCalendarThree.book(start, end)

```
MyCalendarThree();
MyCalendarThree.book(10, 20); // returns 1
MyCalendarThree.book(50, 60); // returns 1
MyCalendarThree.book(10, 40); // returns 2
MyCalendarThree.book(5, 15); // returns 3
MyCalendarThree.book(5, 10); // returns 3
MyCalendarThree.book(25, 55); // returns 3
Explanation: 
The first two events can be booked and are disjoint, so the maximum K-booking is a 1-booking.
The third event [10, 40) intersects the first event, and the maximum K-booking is a 2-booking.
The remaining events cause the maximum K-booking to be only a 3-booking.
Note that the last event locally causes a 2-booking, but the answer is still 3 because
eg. [10, 20), [10, 40), and [5, 15) are still triple booked.
```

## Solution

We can use TreeMap in java, for each event added into map, we will update the value of start and end keys.
map[start] += 1 and map[end] -= 1
And then, traverse the treemap, as it is sorted, we can count the number of 1 in every timestamp, that is the number of event at that time

```java
class MyCalendarThree {
    Map<Integer, Integer> map;
    public MyCalendarThree() {
        map = new TreeMap<>();
    }
    
    public int book(int start, int end) {
        map.put(start, map.getOrDefault(start, 0) + 1);
        map.put(end, map.getOrDefault(end, 0) - 1);
        int cnt = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
            cnt += entry.getValue();
            res = Math.max(res, cnt);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
