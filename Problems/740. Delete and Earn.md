## Description
```
Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.
```

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
```

## Solution

Because for every num in nums, if we skip it, we will get 0, otherwise, we can get num * count(num), so the order doesn't matter.
So we can initialize A, A[i] = i * count(i) for i in nums, and then convert the problem to "select non-adjacent numbers in A to get the max sum"

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        A = [0] * (max(nums or [0]) + 1)
        for i in nums:
            A[i] += i
        pre, cur = 0, 0
        '''
        convert it to: select non-adjacent numbers in A to get the max sum
        we can use dp to deal with it
        '''
        for i in A:
            pre, cur = cur, max(cur, pre + i)
        return cur
```
