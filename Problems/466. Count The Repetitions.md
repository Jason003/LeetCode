## Description
>Define S = [s,n] as the string S which consists of n connected strings s. For example, ["abc", 3] ="abcabcabc".
On the other hand, we define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1. For example, “abc” can be obtained from “abdbec” based on our definition, but it can not be obtained from “acbbe”.
You are given two non-empty strings s1 and s2 (each at most 100 characters long) and two integers 0 ≤ n1 ≤ 106 and 1 ≤ n2 ≤ 106. Now consider the strings S1 and S2, where S1=[s1,n1] and S2=[s2,n2]. Find the maximum integer M such that [S2,M] can be obtained from S1.

```
Input:
s1="acb", n1=4
s2="ab", n2=2

Return:
2
```

## Solution
```
Every time we find a complete s2 in n1*s1, we record three things using a map:

key: current position in s1
value: current position in n*s1 and how many s2 have been found.
Later, we check if current position in s1 has been recorded before, and if so, we can skip reoccurrence of all s1[i0:i](see what i0 and i mean in code below) in n1*s1.
```
```python
class Solution:
    def getMaxRepetitions(self, s1: str, n1: int, s2: str, n2: int) -> int:
        d = {}
        k = 0
        i = 0
        while i < n1 * len(s1):
            r = i % len(s1)
            if r not in d:
                d[r] = (i, k)
            else:
                i0, k0 = d[r]
                n = (n1 * len(s1) - i0) // (i - i0)
                i, k = i0 + n * (i - i0), k0 + n * (k - k0)
            j = 0
            while i < n1 *len(s1) and j < len(s2):
                while i < n1 * len(s1) and s1[i % len(s1)] != s2[j]: 
                    i += 1
                i, j = i + 1, j + 1
            if i >= n1 * len(s1) and j < len(s2): break
            k += 1
        return k // n2
