## Description

>Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

```
Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
```

## Solution

The key point of this problem is to set a value to each node in the tree.
We can set the val by this function: 
  node.left.val = 2 * node.val, node.right.val = 2 * node.val + 1
At the same time, to get the leftmost node in every level, we should initialize a map : {level: leftmost's val}
```python
class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        d, self.res = {}, 1
        def helper(node, val = 0, level = 0):
            if node:
                if level not in d: d[level] = val
                self.res = max(self.res, val - d[level] + 1)
                helper(node.left, val * 2, level + 1)
                helper(node.right, val * 2 + 1, level + 1)
        helper(root)
        return self.res
```
