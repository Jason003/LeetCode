## Description
>Given a string that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can replace any letter in the string with another letter at most k times. 
Find the length of a longest substring containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.

```
Input:
s = "ABAB", k = 2

Output:
4

Explanation:
Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

## Solution

Sliding Window is very efficient for string problems.
From https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/discuss/91271/Java-12-lines-O(n)-sliding-window-solution-with-explanation
```
There's no edge case for this question. The initial step is to extend the window to its limit, that is, the longest we can get to with maximum number of modifications. Until then the variable start will remain at 0.
Then as end increase, the whole substring from 0 to end will violate the rule, so we need to update start accordingly (slide the window). We move start to the right until the whole string satisfy the constraint again. Then each time we reach such situation, we update our max length.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        start, end, n, cnt, mx, res = 0, 0, len(s), collections.Counter(), 0, 0
        while end < n:
            cnt[s[end]] += 1
            mx = max(mx, cnt[s[end]])
            while end - start + 1 - mx > k:
                cnt[s[start]] -= 1
                start += 1
            res = max(res, end - start + 1)
            end += 1
        return res
```

```
Q: I don't understand why it works without updating maxCount after changing the value in the count array. Couldn't any of the counts smaller than maxCount?

A: you may think the maxCount means the upper bound of the 'maxCount' of all the past windows, we may get the wrong length for the current window, but we never miss the result, thinks about this case,k=2:

(0A: 0 is the idx, A is the char)
0A1A2B3C4D5E6F

for window[0A1A2B3C], we get the maxCount=2 for A, and it is still valid, now we move end->4D, we get a invalid window, now the count[A] =1, maxCount is still 2, later we move to end->5E,
the maxCount is still 2, but actually the count for each char in window [2B3C4D5E] is 1, but it does not matter, the maxLength do not update.
```
