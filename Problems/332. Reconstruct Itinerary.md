## Description
>Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

>Note:
If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

>Example 1:

>Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]

>Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]

>Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].But it is larger in lexical order.

```python
class Solution:
    def findItinerary(self, tickets: List[List[str]]) -> List[str]:
        res = collections.deque()
        def dfs(cur):
            '''
            when there is no way to go (graph[cur] is empty), cur 
            should be put in the end of res we finally return,
            and cur will be marked as dead point, then we can find
            the next "no way to go" point to make it as dead point,
            do it over and over again till all of the points are dead
            '''
            while graph[cur]:
                dfs(graph[cur].popleft())
            res.appendleft(cur) 
            
        graph = collections.defaultdict(collections.deque)
        for a, b in sorted(tickets): # sort to get the smallest lexical order
            graph[a].append(b)
        dfs('JFK')
        return list(res)
