## Description
```
Given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we need to choose either x = -K or x = K, and add x to A[i] (only once).

After this process, we have some array B.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.
```

```
Input: A = [1,3,6], K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: B = [4,6,3]
```

@veihbisd:
```
Claim: all the elements to be added 2K must be the left continuous part of the array ([True, ..., True, False, ... False]). 
It can be proved that if in the best solution there are some elements added by 0 between the ones added by 2K, we can add 2K to them, and this operation will not make the solution worse. 
Then we can find where the split it is in one pass.

for example, here A[:j] is added by 2K except A[i], then if we add A[i] by 2K we get B'.
B = [A[0] + 2K, ...,A[i-1]+2K, A[i] + 0, A[i+1] +2K, ..., A[j]+2K, ..., A[j+1]+0, A[n-1]+0]
B' = [A[0] + 2K, ...,A[i-1]+2K, A[i] + 2K, A[i+1] +2K, ..., A[j]+2K, ..., A[j+1]+0, A[n-1]+0]
A[i]+2K is between A[i-1] + 2K and A[i+1] +2K, so it must stand in the range of B.
B' is not worse than B, it can be easily generalized to multiple elements added by 0 between the ones added by 2K.

            mx = max(mx, a + 2 * K)
            mn = min(A[0] + 2 * K, A[i + 1])
            res = min(res, mx - mn)
        return res
