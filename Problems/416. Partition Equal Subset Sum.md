## Description
>Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.
```
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

## Solution
```
We can use dp to deal with this problem, the key point is for every number num in nums array, dp[j] |= dp[j - num] if j >= num
But attention that we should go from larger j to smaller j.
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canPartition(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        s = sum(nums)
        if s % 2 != 0: return False
        target = s // 2
        n = len(nums)
        dp = [False] * (target + 1)
        dp[0] = True
        for i in nums:
            for j in range(target, -1, -1):
                # attention: we can not use range(target + 1)
                # because it will sum one number more than once
                # like [1,2,5], it will make dp[2] = True
                # after that, when it comes to 4, dp[4] = dp[2] || dp[4] = True
                # so we should go desc to avoid it (assign large numbers first and then assign small numbers)
                if j >= i:
                    dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - i]
        return dp[target]
```
