## Description
>Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.
The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```
Input:

              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
Output: 2
```

## Solution

To deal with a tree problem, we use recursion mostly.
In the "path" problem, the usual way is to define a "maxPathDown" function to get the max length of safisfactory left / right path down 
and update the result in this function.
Time complexity: O(n).
```python
class Solution:
    def longestUnivaluePath(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not root: return 0
        self.res = 0
        def maxPathDown(node, val):
            if not node: return 0
            l, r = maxPathDown(node.left, node.val), maxPathDown(node.right, node.val) # get max left and right path down 
            self.res = max(l + r, self.res) # update the result in this helper function
            if node.val != val: return 0
            return max(l, r) + 1
        maxPathDown(root, root.val)
        return self.res
```
