## Description
```
We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.
```

```
Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
```

## Solution

We can deal with this problme using dp.
swap: minimum swaps if we swap A[i] and B[i]
fix: minimum swaps if we don't swap A[i] and B[i]

```python
class Solution:
    def minSwap(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> int:
        swap, fix = 1, 0
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            if A[i - 1] >= B[i] or B[i - 1] >= A[i]:
                # must be the same manipulation as i - 1
                swap += 1
            elif A[i - 1] >= A[i] or B[i - 1] >= B[i]:
                # must be the opposite of i - 1
                fix, swap = swap, fix + 1
            else:
                # can fix or swap, just get the minimum one
                fix, swap = min(fix, swap), min(fix, swap) + 1
        return min(fix, swap)
```
