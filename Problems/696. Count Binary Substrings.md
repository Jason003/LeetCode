## Description
>Give a string s, count the number of non-empty (contiguous) substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.
>Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

```
Input: "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".

Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.

Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
```

## Solution

### Solution 1: dp

Initially, I set 2 arrays zero and one to count the consecutive number of zero or one ending at i.
time: O(n)
space: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        zero = [0] * n
        one = [0] * n
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0': 
                zero[i] = (zero[i - 1] if i > 0 else 0) + 1
                one[i] = 0
                if i - zero[i] >= 0 and one[i - zero[i]] >= zero[i]: res += 1
            else:
                one[i] = (one[i - 1] if i > 0 else 0) + 1
                zero[i] = 0
                if i - one[i] >= 0 and zero[i - one[i]] >= one[i]: res += 1
        return res
```
### Solution 2:
I can count the numbers of consecutive 0 or 1 and then store them in an array A.
For example: "00110011" will be [2, 2, 2, 2]
And then, for each adjacent number in the array A, res += min(A[i], A[i + 1])
time: O(n)
space: O(n)
```python
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        s = list(map(len, s.replace('01', '0 1').replace('10', '1 0').split()))
        return sum(min(a, b) for a, b in zip(s, s[1:]))
```

### Solution 3:
We can optimize the solution 2 to get O(1) space complexity.
Because we only care about A[i - 1] and A[i], we can just set a variable pre to represent A[i - 1].
```python
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        pre = 0
        i, n = 0, len(s)
        res = 0
        while i < n:
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and s[j] == s[i]: j += 1
            res += min(pre, j - i)
            pre = j - i
            i = j
        return res
```
