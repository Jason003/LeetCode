## Description
>Given an array consists of non-negative integers, your task is to count the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

```
Input: [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Valid combinations are: 
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3
```

## Solution

Obviously, we can deal with this problem using the method like 3-sum.
time complexity will be O(n ^ 2)

But we should know that in 3-sum question, we have to let lo and hi to be two numbers that we do sum
In this problem, we should let k as the longest side and i, j (lo, hi) as two shorter sides:
```
for k in ...
  while i < j
    ...
```
Instead of 
```
for i in ...
  while j < k
    ...
```
Because key point of 3-sum is to move lo and hi by one every time to let the sum equal to a certain number, we can not move the certain number, in the second solution, we will move the certain number k, that is wrong !

Full solution:
```python
class Solution:
    def triangleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        res = 0
        n = len(nums)
        for k in range(n - 1, 1, -1):
            i, j = 0, k - 1
            while i < j:
                if nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]:
                    res += j - i
                    j -= 1
                else:
                    i += 1
        return res
```
