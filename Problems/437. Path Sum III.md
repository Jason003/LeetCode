## Description
>You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.
Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.
The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

```
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

## Solution

There are two ways to deal with it.

#### Solution 1:
```
We can use two recursive, one helper function is to calculate the number if we have to include this node, 
but we should do another recursion to make sure that we don't include this node.
The time complexity is O(n ^ 2)
```

```python
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: TreeNode, sum: int) -> int:
        def helper(node, cur):
            if not node: return 0
            return helper(node.left, cur - node.val) + helper(node.right, cur - node.val) + (1 if node.val == cur else 0)
        return helper(root, sum) + self.pathSum(root.left, sum) + self.pathSum(root.right, sum) if root else 0
```

#### Solution 2
```
Reflect on the problem that sum of subarray equals to target, we used a map to store the number of sums we get before and once
we get a new current sum, we can use res += cache[current sum - target], because currentSum - (currentSum - target) == target

In this problem, we can also use this solution, preSum is that cache. Then time complexity is O(n)
```
```python
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: TreeNode, sum: int) -> int:
        # O(n) Solution
        preSum = collections.Counter()
        def helper(node, preSum, curSum):
            if not node: return 0
            curSum += node.val
            res = preSum[curSum - sum]
            preSum[curSum] += 1
            res += helper(node.left, preSum, curSum) + helper(node.right, preSum, curSum)
            '''注意要减一，否则类似[1, -2, -3], -1就会出问题，先计算左边，得到一个-1，存储起来了，如果不减的话
            就会导致到node = -3时res = preSum[-1] = 1，又加了一个1上去
            '''
            preSum[curSum] -= 1 
            return res
        preSum[0] = 1
        return helper(root, preSum, 0)
```
