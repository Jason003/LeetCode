## Description
>Consider the string s to be the infinite wraparound string of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", so s will look like this: "...zabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd....".
Now we have another string p. Your job is to find out how many unique non-empty substrings of p are present in s. In particular, your input is the string p and you need to output the number of different non-empty substrings of p in the string s.

```
Input: "zab"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are six substrings "z", "a", "b", "za", "ab", "zab" of string "zab" in the string s.
```
## Solution

We can use dp to deal with this problem, dp[i] means the number of satisfied substring ended with index i
But we should note that we should find **unique** substrings, therefore, to use a dict to store the current
number ended with letter S[i], finally sum up the values in that dict

```python
class Solution:
    def findSubstringInWraproundString(self, p: str) -> int:
        A = [ord(c) - ord('a') for c in p]
        n = len(A)
        dp = [1] * n
        res = 0
        cnt = collections.Counter()
        for i in range(n):
            if i > 0 and A[i] == (A[i - 1] + 1) % 26:
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1
            cnt[A[i]] = max(cnt[A[i]], dp[i])
        return sum(cnt.values())
```
