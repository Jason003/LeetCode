## Description

```
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Write a data structure CBTInserter that is initialized with a complete binary tree and supports the following operations:

CBTInserter(TreeNode root) initializes the data structure on a given tree with head node root;
CBTInserter.insert(int v) will insert a TreeNode into the tree with value node.val = v so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the inserted TreeNode;
CBTInserter.get_root() will return the head node of the tree.
```
```
Input: inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","get_root"], inputs = [[[1]],[2],[]]
Output: [null,1,[1,2]]
```

## Solution

```
This solution is so great, the key point is that the parent of a certain node in tree array is in index n // 2 - 1, n is the length before we insert it
```

```python
class CBTInserter:

    def __init__(self, root: TreeNode):
        self.tree = [root]
        for node in self.tree:
            if node.left: self.tree.append(node.left)
            if node.right: self.tree.append(node.right)

    def insert(self, v: int) -> int:
        n = len(self.tree)
        self.tree.append(TreeNode(v))
        if n % 2:
            self.tree[(n - 1) // 2].left = self.tree[-1]
        else:
            self.tree[(n - 1) // 2].right = self.tree[-1]
        return self.tree[(n - 1) // 2].val

    def get_root(self) -> TreeNode:
        return self.tree[0]
```
