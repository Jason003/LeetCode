## Description
>Given a non-negative integer, you could swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number. Return the maximum valued number you could get.

```
Input: 2736
Output: 7236
Explanation: Swap the number 2 and the number 7.
```

## Solution
We can first initialize an idx map that stores every number's last position.
And then scan from begining to end, once there is a following number (from 9 to 0) that is bigger than it, just swap these 2 numbers and return it.

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumSwap(self, num: int) -> int:
        d = list(str(num))
        n = len(d)
        idx = {}
        for i in range(n):
            idx[d[i]] = i
        for i in range(n):
            for c in range(9, -1, -1):
                c = chr(c + ord('0'))
                if c in d and c > d[i] and idx[c] > i:
                    d[i], d[idx[c]] = d[idx[c]], d[i]
                    return int(''.join(d))
        return num
```
