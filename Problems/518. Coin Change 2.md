## Description
>You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

## Solution

We can use cached dfs or dp to deal with this problem, dp is better, we can use O(amount) space and O(amount * n) time complexity.

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        # cache = {}
        # coins.sort()
        # def dfs(idx, cur):
        #     if cur == 0: return 1
        #     if cur < 0: return 0
        #     if (idx, cur) in cache: return cache[idx, cur]
        #     res = 0
        #     for i in range(idx, len(coins)):
        #         if cur >= coins[i]:
        #             res += dfs(i, cur - coins[i])
        #         else: break
        #     cache[idx, cur] = res
        #     return res
        # return dfs(0, amount)
        
        n = len(coins)
        dp = [1] + [0] * amount
        for c in coins:
            # package problem, if it can be reused, in the inner loop, we should go from lo to hi
            # because dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - coins[i]], otherwise, in the inner loop, we should go from hi
            # to low, because dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - coins[i]]
            for i in range(c, amount + 1):
                dp[i] += dp[i - c]
        return dp[amount]
```
