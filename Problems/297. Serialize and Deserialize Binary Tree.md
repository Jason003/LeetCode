Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example: 

You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
```

This problem is marked as 'Hard', however, it is not so difficult.

To begin with, we should know how to serialize a tree to a string, it is very easy to implement by dfs.

But keep in your mind that once we meet an empty node, we should not return '', otherwise, a string might represent many different trees.

Therefore, we should return some special character once we meet an empty node:

```
def serialize(self, root):
    if not root: return '#'
    return str(root.val) + ',' + self.serialize(root.left) + ',' + self.serialize(root.right)
```

Then how to deserialize it?

We should take the first value in the string as our root, and then pop it out, then get the left and right child by recursion.

How to pop the first value in an array easily? Right! By Deque~

```
def deserialize(self, data):
    def dfs(dq):
        if dq[0] == '#':
            dq.popleft()
            return None
        root = TreeNode(int(dq.popleft()))
        root.left, root.right = dfs(dq), dfs(dq)
        return root
    return dfs(collections.deque(data.split(',')))
```
